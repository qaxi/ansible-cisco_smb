  module: ciscosmb_hostname
  short_description: hostname resource module
  description:
  - This module provides declarative management of hostname on Cisco IOS devices.
  version_added: 2.7.0
  author:
  - Sagar Paul (@KB-perByte)
  notes:
  - Tested against Cisco IOSv Version 15.6.
  - This module works with connection C(network_cli).
  options:
    config:
      description: A dictionary of hostname options
      type: dict
      suboptions:
        hostname:
          description: set hostname for IOS
          type: str
    running_config:
      description:
        - This option is used only with state I(parsed).
        - The value of this option should be the output received from the IOS device
          by executing the command B(show running-config | section ^hostname).
        - The state I(parsed) reads the configuration from C(running_config) option and
          transforms it into Ansible structured data as per the resource module's argspec
          and the value is then returned in the I(parsed) key within the result.
      type: str
    state:
      choices:
      - merged
      - replaced
      - overridden
      - deleted
      - rendered
      - gathered
      - parsed
      default: merged
      description:
        - The state the configuration should be left in
        - The states I(rendered), I(gathered) and I(parsed) does not perform any change
          on the device.
        - The state I(rendered) will transform the configuration in C(config) option to
          platform specific CLI commands which will be returned in the I(rendered) key
          within the result. For state I(rendered) active connection to remote host is
          not required.
        - The states I(merged), I(replaced) and I(overridden) have identical
          behaviour for this module.
        - The state I(gathered) will fetch the running configuration from device and transform
          it into structured data in the format as per the resource module argspec and
          the value is returned in the I(gathered) key within the result.
        - The state I(parsed) reads the configuration from C(running_config) option and
          transforms it into JSON format as per the resource module parameters and the
          value is returned in the I(parsed) key within the result. The value of C(running_config)
          option should be the same format as the output of command
          I(show running-config | section ^hostname) executed on device. For state I(parsed) active
          connection to remote host is not required.
